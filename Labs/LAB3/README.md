# Lab 3 | Python
## George Redfern
### Lab Instructions:
Go to the IOT GitHub repository and review lesson 3. Install required Python packages such as jdcal, astral, and geopy. Execute the following code:
cd ~/iot, cd *3, python3 julian.py, python3 date_example.py, python3 datetime_example.py, python3 time_example.py, python3 sun.py "New York", python3 moon.py, python3 coordinates.py "Samuel C. Williams Library", python3 address.py "40.74480675, -74.02532861159351", python3 cpu.py, python3 battery.py, python3 documentstats.py document.txt.
Document the results to your GitHub repository.

# Summary
In this lab, I explored various Python packages such as pytz and psutil to work with time zones and system resources. I encountered errors related to missing modules and successfully resolved them by installing the necessary libraries using pip. This process enhanced my understanding of package management in Python.

I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System- George Redfern
