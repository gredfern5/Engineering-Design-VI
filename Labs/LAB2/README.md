# Summary
In this lab, I explored a variety of important terminal commands. Through completing the activities, I gained hands-on experience with commands related to viewing system information, managing processes and directories, handling file operations, working with networks, and using GIT for version control. This lab helped me develop a stronger understanding of how to interact with the system through the terminal, and it built a solid foundation for more advanced command-line tasks in the future.

I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System- George Redfern
